# DataCommunication_Project
A dataset about flight satisfaction is provided to you (flight_satisfaction.csv).
1- Data preparation: Import the data (all data) then modify the dataset
according to the following process:
- Open the "project_student_data.ipynb" and replace STUID with your
personal student ID then run the code. It will give you your exclusive
features.
- Then you only need those selected features

2- Data cleaning: Handle missing or duplicate data, deal with outliers, and
perform data type conversions.

3- Data Manipulation and transformation: Perform operations like selecting
specific columns, filtering rows, adding or removing columns, and transforming
data as needed. (consider the correlation between features as if it needed).
Besides those things, you should consider normalization, scaling etc.

4- Data Analysis:
a) The purpose of this exercise is to compute the satisfaction of flight. in this part,
you will be asked to calculate this (you are free to choose neural network
models or any other method).
For this case, you should:
- Choose 2000 random rows and split them to test and train
- Define your model
- Train your model and fit it
- Do these steps with 5000 rows and compare it with the first scenario
b) You should also order features from most effective to least one.

5- Data Visualization: Use libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly to visualize
the data.

6- Drawing conclusions and documentation: Based on the analysis and modeling
results, draw conclusions and insights from the data.
Document your process, findings, and any important steps taken.
